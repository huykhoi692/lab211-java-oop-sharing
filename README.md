# LAB211 - Object-Oriented Programming with Java

Repository for my LAB211 coursework at FPT University. It includes Java OOP exercises, lab submissions, and supporting notes that I am sharing publicly.

## Setup
Follow these steps to prepare your environment:
1. **Install JDK 17+**
   - Download the installer for your OS from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) or Oracle.
   - Install and ensure `java -version` shows the installed JDK on your PATH.
2. **Install Apache NetBeans**
   - Download the latest Apache NetBeans package from the [official site](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/).
   - Run the installer and select the JDK you installed when prompted.
3. **Clone the repository**
   - `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/-LAB211-OOP-with-Java.git`
   - Open the cloned folder in NetBeans and configure the project SDK if prompted.

## Contents
- Core OOP practice: classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces
- Lab assignments and problem solutions
- Utilities or notes that support learning and sharing with others

## How to use
Browse the folders for examples, reuse snippets for learning, or compare solutions. Contributions and suggestions are welcome.
